Generators
Generator is a function which is responsible to generate a sequence of values.
We can write generator functions just like ordinary functions, but it uses yield keyword to
return values.

"""Generators allow you to produce a sequence of values over time, without having to store all
of them in memory at once. Instead, the generator returns each value as it is requested, using
the "yield" statement"""
